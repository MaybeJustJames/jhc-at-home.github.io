              <li>Much better! I'm from Australia. Let's zoom in a little...</li>
              <li>I grew up in a town called Beechworth. It's a small town of about 3000 people in the south-east.</li>
              <li>Here's an outline of Belgium on Australia. You can make out Beechworth.</li>
              <li>
                And you can see here that the entirety of Belgium fits into the area around which I grew up
                quite easily.
              </li>
              <li>
                Here's a picture of central Beechworth. Here's a fun fact for you. Every town in Belgium might
                have a church. Every town in Australia has a prison. You can just see the old Beechworth prison
                in the background there. Naturally, I never did anything silly or dangerous though...
              </li>
              <li>... oo how did that get there!</li>
              <li>So it's a picturesque rural area.</li>
              <li>And I grew up on a small farm about 10km outside of Beechworth.</li>

          <aside class="notes">
            I applied a statistical inference technique known as &quot;Minimum Message Length&quot;
            to the problem of <em>aligning</em> protein structures.

            Alignment is the assignment of amino acid residue-residue correspondencdes. A good alignment
            is biologically meaningful but this comes down to a trade-off between how closely the structures
            match and the number of assigned correspondences.

            The Minimum Message Length technique combines statistical inference and data compression.
            It provides a rigorous basis for hypothesis testing. If an alignment is a hypothesis on the
            relationship between 2 structures, I should be able to use it to compress the structural data
            of the 2 structures into a shorter message than I can with no alignment at all.
            So the <em>best</em> alignment is the alignment that gives me the shortest (most compressed)
            message.

            So I have a big interest in data compression. I also have a big interest in statistical inference.
            Incidentally, this isn't the only thing that happened when I left home...

            After moving here I wanted to try working in industry. I got a job working for a company building
